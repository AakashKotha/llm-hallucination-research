CO = Cardiac output
V₁ = Volume of injectate
TB = Blood temperature
TI = Injectate temperature

389,Conclusive test for semen: Jharkhand 11,Healthcare,Acid phosphatase test,39,closed-ended,topical,qualitative,"The conclusive test for detecting semen is the acid phosphatase test followed by microscopic identification of spermatozoa. The acid phosphatase test serves as a presumptive test, while the microscopic visualization of sperm cells provides definitive confirmation. This is commonly used in forensic analysis and is referenced in forensic science manuals including those used in Jharkhand and other Indian states.",2025-05-25,412
390,A 80 years old male presented with lung abscess in left upper zone. Best treatment of modalities is,Healthcare,Antibiotics according to organisms,99,closed-ended,topical,qualitative,"The best treatment for lung abscess in an elderly patient typically follows a stepwise approach:

Primary treatment:
- Broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics for 4-6 weeks
- Initial empiric therapy should cover both aerobic and anaerobic organisms
- Common regimens include:
  - Clindamycin
  - Ampicillin-sulbactam
  - Or combination of penicillin and metronidazole

Supportive measures:
- Postural drainage
- Chest physiotherapy
- Adequate hydration
- Nutritional support

Surgical intervention is reserved for cases that fail medical management or have complications:
- Persistent sepsis despite antibiotics
- Massive hemoptysis
- Large cavity size (>6cm)
- Suspected malignancy

For an 80-year-old patient, conservative medical management with antibiotics is typically the first choice unless complications necessitate surgery, considering age-related risks of surgical intervention.

Regular monitoring of clinical response and radiological improvement is essential to adjust treatment as needed.",2025-05-25,1001
391,Sigmoid volvulus rotation occurs,Healthcare,Anticlockwise,32,closed-ended,general,qualitative,"Sigmoid volvulus typically rotates in a counterclockwise direction around its mesenteric axis, with the twist usually occurring between 180 to 540 degrees. The rotation most commonly happens at the point where the relatively mobile sigmoid colon twists around its elongated and narrow mesentery. This twisting can lead to bowel obstruction, vascular compromise, and potential gangrene if not treated promptly.",2025-05-25,409
392,"A 25 year old female underwent septic aboion, which is the most likely site for embolism of tricuspid valve vegetation?",Healthcare,Lung,119,closed-ended,general,qualitative,"The pulmonary arteries are the most likely site for embolism of tricuspid valve vegetation. This occurs because blood flows from the right side of the heart (where the tricuspid valve is located) directly into the pulmonary arteries. Any vegetations or clots that break off from the tricuspid valve will follow this natural blood flow path and lodge in the pulmonary vasculature, potentially causing pulmonary embolism. This is different from left-sided endocarditis, where emboli typically go to the systemic circulation.",2025-05-25,522
393,What effect does hyperventilation have on the oxygen binding affinity of hemoglobin?,Healthcare,P50 decreases and the oxygen affinity increases,84,closed-ended,general,qualitative,"Hyperventilation increases oxygen binding affinity of hemoglobin through respiratory alkalosis. When a person hyperventilates, they exhale excessive CO2, which raises blood pH. This pH increase shifts the oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve to the left (Bohr effect), causing hemoglobin to bind oxygen more tightly. As a result, hemoglobin releases less oxygen to tissues, despite having high oxygen saturation in the blood. This can actually lead to tissue hypoxia even though arterial oxygen levels remain normal or elevated.",2025-05-25,528
394,Deletion of one alpha globin gene on one chromosome is best defined as,Healthcare,Alpha thalassemia silent carrier,70,closed-ended,general,qualitative,"Alpha thalassemia trait (silent carrier), characterized by the deletion of one alpha globin gene (-α/αα) out of the normal four alpha globin genes. This condition is also known as alpha+ thalassemia heterozygosity and typically causes minimal or no clinical symptoms, with slight or no reduction in hemoglobin levels.",2025-05-25,317
395,True statement regarding Prevalence:,Healthcare,Measures all cases,36,closed-ended,general,qualitative,"Prevalence measures the total number of existing cases (both old and new) of a disease or condition in a population at a specific point in time or during a particular period, expressed as a proportion of the population at risk.",2025-05-25,227
396,Thyroid hormone receptor which is predominantly expressed in CNS/Brain -,Healthcare,b - 1,72,closed-ended,general,qualitative,"TRβ (Thyroid Hormone Receptor Beta) is the predominant thyroid hormone receptor expressed in the central nervous system and brain. Specifically, the TRβ1 and TRβ2 isoforms are highly expressed in the developing and adult brain, where they play crucial roles in neuronal development, differentiation, and function. TRβ2 is particularly important in the development of sensory systems, including the auditory and visual pathways.",2025-05-25,427
397,Investigation of choice for hydrocephalus in infants:,Healthcare,Cranial USG,53,closed-ended,general,qualitative,"CT scan without contrast is the initial imaging investigation of choice for suspected hydrocephalus in infants. However, in infants with open fontanelles, head ultrasound can also be used as a screening tool since it is radiation-free, readily available, and allows real-time imaging through the fontanelle window. MRI is typically used as a follow-up study to better characterize the cause of hydrocephalus and evaluate associated brain abnormalities, but it usually requires sedation in infants and is not typically the first-line investigation.",2025-05-25,547

399,"In children below age of 8 years, high Level of cranio-facial disjunction of Lefort III classification is rarely seen because:",Healthcare,There is lack of poorly developed ethmoidal & sphenoidal sin us,126,closed-ended,general,qualitative,"The high level cranio-facial disjunction of Lefort III classification is rarely seen in children under 8 years because the facial sutures are not fully fused at this age. The incomplete ossification and presence of growth centers in the facial skeleton make these structures more flexible and less likely to fracture along the classic Lefort III pattern. Additionally, the pediatric facial bones are more elastic and tend to bend rather than break cleanly, resulting in greenstick fractures rather than complete separations typical of Lefort III fractures.",2025-05-25,556
400,"Middle aged man presents with complaints of weakness, fatigue and hyperpigmentation. On examination hepatomegaly and Hypoglycemia are present. Diagnosis",Healthcare,Hemochromatosis,152,closed-ended,general,qualitative,"Hemochromatosis or Addison's Disease (Primary Adrenal Insufficiency) are the main differential diagnoses, with Addison's Disease being more likely given the presentation.

Key findings supporting Addison's Disease:
- Weakness and fatigue
- Hyperpigmentation (due to increased ACTH)
- Hypoglycemia (due to cortisol deficiency)
- Hepatomegaly can occur in Addison's
